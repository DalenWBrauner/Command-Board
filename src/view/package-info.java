/** This is the View Package built to layover the Command Board created by Dalen. 
 * 
 * The package written using JavaFX's libraries for creating graphical user interfaces.
 * 
 * In JavaFX, you have scenes that take up the main view at any given time. We've broken ours up into a menu selection scene, a game scene, and a victory scene.
 * 
 * The game scene, wherein you actually play Command Board, is broken up into a "joystick" and "board" which organize the game as well as how we split up the work.
